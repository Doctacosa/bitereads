# BiteReads

**NOW DEPRECATED as [Mozilla is preparing to shut down Pocket](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket). Thanks for your interest!**

BiteReads, a frontend to Pocket. This much smaller interface makes it more usable on small phone displays and browser windows. [Visit the live version](https://bitereads.interordi.com/)!

## Configuration

Edit `config.inc.php` with a key obtained by [creating a new Pocket app](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new). You need the **Modify** and **Retrieve** permissions in order to use all features.

No storage is done on the web server, everything being handled through API calls and the user's session data.
